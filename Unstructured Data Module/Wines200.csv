US,Martinez & Martinez,Pinot Grigio,86,17,"Aromas of ripe (leaning almost overripe) apple, melon and orange peel are followed by medium-sweet fruit flavors. It needs more acid to stand it up."
US,Ironstone,Cabernet Franc,86,12,"Strong wood smoke and grilled meat aromas lead to equally assertive oak and dried herb flavors, giving this wine extreme personality. It has medium body and rather soft tannins and texture to balance."
US,Leaping Horse,Chardonnay,86,10,"This medium-bodied wine has more earthy and floral flavors than straightforward fruit, so it's something a bit different. Well-priced and easy to drink, it can please a crowd."
US,Kitchen Sink,White Blend,86,13,"This wine is dry and substantial, emphasizing earthy, savory flavors over fruity ones. An attractive walnut and almond element carries through from the aroma to the flavors."
US,Kuleto Estate,Chardonnay,86,45,"This is from a hillside estate vineyard and is entirely barrel fermented, its oak subtle and supportive. Medium bodied and not overripe, it offers honeysuckle aromas and lime and lemon rind flavors."
Portugal,Wines & Winemakers,Portuguese Red,86,12,"This state-owned estate of forests and vineyards grows organic grapes. This wine, softly structured and ripe has light black fruits and plenty of acidity. An undercurrent of tannin keeps the wine in order and will allow it to age. Drink from 2018."
Argentina,Zorzal,Ros,86,12,"This copper-tinted ros of Pinot Noir smells like a rubber gym ball and citrus fruits. A full round bouncy palate brings it around, while dry citrus and stone-fruit flavors show a skins-like quality on a steady finish."
US,Charles Krug,Cabernet Sauvignon,86,125,"This mountain-grown wine is hugely tannic and oaky, hard to penetrate in its full-bodied ripeness. Smoky oak and currant flavors vie for attention against a backdrop of concentration and power."
US,Millbrook,Riesling,86,25,"Savory apples and pears mingle into lemon and bramble in this slightly earthy off-dry Riesling. Sunny tangerine acidity is easy but bright, leading a delicately sweet finish."
South Africa,Waterkloof,Sauvignon Blanc,86,20,"Muted aromas of tart gooseberry and lime peel dance in the bouquet, while pithy flavors of plum skin, currant and citrus rind unfold on the lightweight, slightly astringent palate. Pleasant hints of fresh herbs and saline make a fleeting impression on the close."
Argentina,Vialba,Malbec,86,15,"Aromas of prune, raisin and black plum are full and gritty. A chunky full-bodied palate feels grabby, while this tastes of generic blackberry, burnt coffee and dark chocolate. A steady plump, rubbery finish closes the show."
Spain,Casa de la Ermita,Monastrell,86,,"Aromas of brandied cherry and crme de cassis include a horsey sidenote and some heat. This sweet Monastrell smacks the palate with hard tannins. Flavors of black cherry, cassis and baked plum finish blocky."
France,Chteau Clment Termes,Ros,86,20,"This pale pink-grey colored wine is a blend of Duras and Merlot. It is lively and fruity, with a red-currant flavor, delicious crisp acidity and a soft, lively aftertaste. Drink now."
France,Chteau Coutinel,Gamay,86,15,This softly fruity wine has the lightest of tannins and plenty of simple red-berry fruits. There is an earthy edge to the young wine as well as plenty of acidity at the end. Drink now.
Portugal,Adega Cooperativa de Borba,Portuguese Red,86,7,"This broad, fruity wine brings out ripe berry flavors in spades. It has generous fruit, soft tannins and a smooth, open texture. Drink now."
US,MacPhail,Pinot Noir,91,59,"Let this burly, big-boned beauty open to fully enjoy its robust oak and fistfuls of black cherry, the oak showing in terms of toasty, slightly reductive aromas. A smooth texture keeps the wine flowing along a concentrated highway of power and ripeness."
US,Foursight,Pinot Noir,91,49,"This small-quantity selection from within the Charles Vineyard was fermented by native yeast, and neither fined nor filtered. It is quite aromatic, full bodied and moderately fruity, and has a nice rounded mouthfeel, generous red-cherry and spice flavors and good structure from acidity and mild tannins. Tart cherry lingers on the finish."
US,Goat Bubbles,Sparkling Blend,91,42,"A deeper salmon color with elegantly lacy bubbles and a slight cloudy appearance, this sparkler by Norm Yost offers dessicated watermelon, dried orange blossoms, yeast, citrus rinds and fresher strawberry notes on the nose. Tart raspberry and yeasty melon show on the palate, which offers a salty component as well as a surprising but nice amount of grip."
US,Grgich Hills,Chardonnay,91,93,"This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021."
US,Navarro,Pinot Noir,91,32,"This wine is tasty, tangy and nervy, bringing a very refreshing and appetizing mouthfeel, and wonderful fresh acidity. All of that tang shows good fruitiness too, as the red-cherry and cranberry flavors are vivid and concentrated. It's a versatile wine to drink now or buy by the case to save some bottles for more aging."
US,Navarro,Pinot Noir,91,20,"This medium-bodied wine has a compelling blend of restraint and power. It offers modest, fruity aromas at first, then nice tart fruit flavors that start off lean and soon expand exponentially in the mouth before tapering off elegantly on the finish. With little oak flavor in the way, it gives pure Pinot sophistication."
US,Renwood,Zinfandel,90,100,"Renwood's tiny two-barrel production of its most expensive Zinfandel has aromas like vanilla and coconut and flavors as rich as milk chocolate and strawberry jam. This full-bodied wine is practically a liquid dessert, though it's not overly sweet. It's full-bodied, smooth and broad in texture."
US,Trinchero,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,50,"This is a thick, chocolatey wine with a side of leather and black pepper that appeals on multiple levels. Full-bodied concentration gives way to a smooth, rounded palate robust in blackberry and vanilla."
Spain,Pagos del Rey,Tempranillo,90,22,"Aromas of strawberry, currant and spice are good in a subtle, non-pushy way. Fresh and grabby on the palate, this tastes of red fruits, baking spices and cocoa. Drying tannins along with cassis and chocolate flavors push a healthy finish. Drink through 2020."
Italy,Biondi,White Blend,90,45,"Scents of Spanish broom, pineapple, orchard fruit and a saline note meld together in the glass. The focused palate offers mature apple, peach, botanical herb and mineral alongside firm acidity."
Italy,Cantine di Marzo,Greco,90,18,"Juicy and delicious, this has aromas of ripe orchard fruit and fragrant Spanish broom. The succulent palate doles out crisp Granny Smith apple, Anjou pear, nectarine and mineral alongside bright acidity."
US,Alexander-Smith,Chardonnay,90,45,"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows chalk, slate and wet-sand minerality on the nose, alongside Asian pear flesh, kiwi and honeydew fruit notes. The texture is quite pithy once sipped, showing grapefruit and apple skins, and then it warms toward yellow pears and a sea salt warmth."
US,Andis,Barbera,90,26,"Meaty, smoky aromas and good, high-amplitude fruit flavors give a robust personality to this full-bodied, dry and firmly tannic wine. It will make a good pairing with pasta, roasted birds or grilled meat."
US,Benziger,Chardonnay,90,16,"This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love. Lemon peel, apple skin and pear play together well, never becoming distracting, but instead integrating well with one another and the light hint of oak. Food friendly, it's also a great deal."
US,Beaucanon,Cabernet Sauvignon,90,30,"While Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, all five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here. Dark in color, a combination of black pepper and black-fruit syrup meets earthy and dry tannins. This structured wine needs time. Cellar through 2020."
US,Brecon Estate,Grenache,90,42,"Quite dark in color, brooding aromas of olallieberry, blackberry, grape soda, plums and concentrated purple flowers appease the nose on this bottling from one of Paso's newly designated appellations. The palate blends licorice, turned earth and eucalyptus with a fresh pomegranate juice flavor."
US,Peachy Canyon,Zinfandel,90,38,"A nose of sour cherry and cranberry meshes with sandalwood and savory herbs on this single-site study by the longtime Paso producer. The palate is overflowing with oregano and other dried garden herbs, laid against a juicy red and purple-fruit frame."
US,Three,Rhne-style Red Blend,90,48,"Heavy fruit concentration meets thick, velvety tannins in this full-bodied, deeply colored and extremely flavorful wine. It's big enough to pair with big proteins, and concentrated enough to keep improving in the cellar. Best after 2019."
Spain,Valdelacierva,Tempranillo,90,17,"Cherry, plum, vanilla and mild oak aromas feed into a medium-bodied, elegant palate with plum and cherry flavors supported by a touch of toasty oak and vanilla. Notes of caf mocha and toast grace a crisp finish that isn't trying too hard."
France,Chteau de Lancyre,Ros,90,18,"Attractive fruity tones of red currant, raspberry and strawberry hull dance in the bouquet of this pretty ros, graced by garrigue accents of lavender and rosemary. Flavors of red berry skin and peach pit unfold on the medium-weight palate, framed by soft tannins and a delicate spice note that lingers on the close."
France,Chteau Suau,Ros,90,15,"Lightly structured, this is a balanced, ripe wine. It has profited from the good vintage to offer strawberry, raspberry and citrus flavors that are well balanced and textured. Drink this attractive wine now."
US,Clif Family,Sauvignon Blanc,90,28,"A sublime twist of citrus lies at the heart of this light yet complex white, which is refreshing and layered with a subtle bite of underlying oak. From a dry-farmed vineyard maintained by the same family for 30 years, this whole-cluster pressed wine was given time in a majority of stainless steel and neutral French oak. It shines in moderate acidity and tropical flair."
US,Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard,Grenache,90,25,"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors."
US,Schmidt,Chardonnay,90,26,"Estate grown and aged in Stainless steel, this racy and pungent wine is packed with rich, juicy fruit flavors. Apple, lemon-lime and tangerine are in the mix, showing that Chardonnay does not always need oak flavors to have real power."
US,Stephen Ross,Albario,90,24,"Clean, sharp and zesty fruit blossom aromas meet with ripe pomelo and green apple scents on the nose of this wine by Steve Dooley. A fresh, tingling acidity shows on the sip, which is a tad sour with stone fruit skins but bountiful in a slate-driven minerality and grippy texture. Cool climate Albario has much promise in the state."
US,Goldeneye,Pinot Noir,90,55,"Red-cherry and strawberry aromas meld with rich fruit and warm baking-spice flavors to make this full-bodied wine hard to resist. The style is in the ripe, pastry shop mode, and soft tannins and acidity complete the picture."
US,Grgich Hills,Zinfandel,90,36,"This is an exuberantly fruity, spicy and robust wine, speckled with 2% Petite Sirah. Dark and full of red berry flavor, the palate is dusted in brown sugar and black pepper. Ripe and concentrated, it drinks smooth and elegant despite its serious power."
Spain,Mar de Vias,Albario,90,17,"Aromas of white flowers, stone fruits and lees are typical of well-made Albario. A juicy, elegant palate with a mix of citrus and stone-fruit flavors is lasting, with a hint of pithy character coming up on the finish."
US,Kessler-Haak,Syrah,90,40,"Quite vibrant and floral on the nose, this shows deep blackberry and both dried and fresh purple-flower elements as well as a baked berry pastry. The flavors are well integrated on the palate, where cooked blackberries in a vanilla pie crust combine with juicy strawberry, peppercorns and rosemary spice."
US,Larner,Malvasia Bianca,90,28,"This most intriguing white grape, which the Larners grow as an ode to their Italian past, shows a sweet nose with a bone dry palate. Sugary citrus scents of orange blossoms and peach syrup give way to a brisk palate full of honeysuckle, night jasmine and a nearly pine needle bitterness that cuts dynamically through it all."
US,Bomb,Pinot Noir,89,50,"Reflecting the vintage, this Pinot is light and lithe in style. It shows tart cherry fruit and suggestions of chocolate, with bright acidity and a thin finish."
Greece,Hatzimichalis,White Blend,89,24,"This wine is a conversation starter, with its nose of mandarin orange, lemon peel and vanilla. On the palate, white flowers, citrus and lush tropical fruits mingle well. Pair with salmon and poultry."
Spain,Bohigas,Sparkling Blend,89,17,"Dusty, leesy aromas of apple and vanilla are sturdy. This brut Cava is fresh and modestly elegant on the palate, with lime, apple and tarragon flavors. A dry, confident finish offers apple and citrus flavors and a sense of ease."
Greece,Boutari,Assyrtiko,89,21,"Bright aromas of citrus and tropical fruit give this easygoing white an easy appeal. Balanced and fresh, it's an elegant wine that will pair well with grilled fish and salads."
Greece,Alpha Estate,Malagouzia,89,18,"Peach, pear and lemon on the nose start this cheerful white from Alpha Estate. On the palate, it offers some complexity of exotic fruit and with a vein of acidity. Soft overall in profile, this wine is easygoing and enjoyable."
Chile,Via Bisquertt,Carmenre,89,20,"Lightly herbal, horsey aromas of blueberry, black plum and cardamom are ripe by Carmenre standards. Hailing from a hot vintage, this is a bit flabby in feel, with soft tannins. Chunky plum and blackberry flavors finish with notes of licorice and mint along with a chewy, syrupy feel."
France,Chateau Quattre,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,20,"This well-balanced, fruity wine allows space for some solid dry tannins that also show wood aging. Berry fruits shine through the structure to give a juicy character that is underlined by the fresh acidity at the end."
US,Ledger David,Sangiovese,89,24,"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip."
Spain,CVNE,Tempranillo,89,44,"Aromas of leather, roast plum and compost are challenging and not immediately inviting. In the mouth, this shows rubbery tannins and juicy acidity. Saucy, herbal plum and currant flavors ride on a beam of acidity toward an earthy, tomatoey finish with a lightly leafy aftertaste."
Chile,Estampa,Red Blend,89,19,"Staunch berry, cassis and spice aromas are friendly and congruent. This Malbec-led blend is jammy in feel, a bit hollow in the middle, and easy to like as a whole. Blackberry and blueberry flavors finish fleshy, with soft tannins."
US,Foxen 7200,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,89,42,"Winemaker Billy Wathen blends 60% Merlot and 40% Cabernet Franc into this blend that's named after the U.S. Geologic Survey's name for Happy Canyon. A nose of dried oregano and thyme has a Bing cherry backdrop, with a palate of green peppers, blackberries and tomato leaf."
US,Irvine Family Vineyards,Pinot Noir,89,35,"A blend of fruit from three Rogue Valley sites, this is a fine example of the style of Pinot made in Southern Oregon. The estate vineyard sits at 2,100 feet on a steep, east-facing slope, with densely planted vines. It's a big, blocky, full-bodied wine, loaded with flavors of black cherry, black coffee and barrel toast. Tannins are substantial, but the flavors are full and forward. What it lacks in elegance it makes up for in immediate likeability."
Spain,Marqus de Cceres,Tempranillo Blend,89,44,"Dense, tarry aromas of asphalt and rubbery boysenberry are hefty but also a bit flat. This has a tannic mouthfeel to go with blackberry, prune and raisin flavors. Toast, bitter chocolate and full-bodied weight push the finish on this oaky, ripe Rioja. Drink through 2020."
US,Matchbook,Syrah,89,16,"This medium-bodied wine shows an array of smoky, meaty aromas, along with ripe plum and tart blackberry flavors. Not at all overripe, but made with some restraint, it allows savory flavors like tarragon and anise to peek through. The blend includes 9% Cabernet Sauvignon."
US,Eberle,Viognier,89,23,"The grape's usual peachy aromas show on this wine from regional pioneer Gary Eberle, along with lemon juice, honey and a touch of minerality. There is a nice mineral-driven tension on the palate, with flavors of apple and pear cider. It's a solid, down-the-middle take on the grape_not too ripe, not too thin."
US,Silvan Ridge,Pinot Noir,89,36,"Tightly focused, as is often true of single-vineyard bottlings, this matches spicy berry fruit to light barrel flavors of milk chocolate. It's smooth and accessible, but finishes a bit short."
Italy,Tenuta degli Dei,Red Blend,89,25,"Crushed plum, espresso, tobacco and cedar aromas unfold in the glass. A blend of 90% Merlot and 10% Alicante, the straightforward palate offers blackberries, red currants, clove and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins."
Italy,Poggio Mandorlo,Red Blend,89,22,"Aromas of wild berries, violets and a whiff of spice lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. The savory, easygoing palate offers mature black cherry, clove and black pepper alongside lithe tannins. Drink through 2016."
Portugal,Quinta das Carvalhas,Touriga Nacional,89,20,"Structured and firm, this is a dry wine with the potential of fine fruit in the future. Acidity cuts through the texture promising the freshness of black currants and berries. It's a perfumed wine that can still age. Drink from 2016."
US,Occasio,Chardonnay,89,25,"This has a light yellow color with a touch of green and a subtle smell of crisp green apples. Flavors that are richer than expected, like poached pears, butter and fig. The texture is rich, the body full and the ripe flavors linger on the finish."
US,Sanford,Pinot Noir,89,42,"Rhubarb, cola and pencil shavings emerge from the glass on this appellation blend from the longtime Santa Rosa Road winery, today owned by the Terlato family. Deeply earthy aromas of beet juice, root beer and dried berries arise on the palate, showing the region's typical blend of soil minerality and dark fruit."
Chile,Santa Alba,Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc,89,30,"Dark, charred, lemony aromas of graphite, licorice and blackberry are horsey and baked. This blend of 85% Cab Sauv and 15% Cab Franc has an intense, blocky, pinching palate and heavy flavors of black fruits, resiny oak, spice and salt. A woody, tannic, raw feel to the finish creates a bumpy landing. Drink through 2021."
Greece,Boutari,Agiorgitiko,89,17,"Aromas of leather, cherry and plum lead this balanced red from Boutari. Ripe cherry, cedar and cinnamon flavors carry the palate, with soft tannins giving a sultry feel."
US,Foursight,Pinot Noir,89,49,"Made from what Californians call the Pommard clone, this has a light, traditional garnet color. Fresh and lively fruit aromas resemble cranberries and red cherries, followed by tangy fruit and cinnamon flavors of medium intensity, supported by firm acidity and moderate tannins."
France,Ogier,Rhne-style Red Blend,89,16,"This is aged in oak, but the vessels are large casks, or foudres, so the impact isn't that noticeable. The wine is meaty and savory on the nose, but the palate shows more herb-garrigue flavors and superripe cherry fruit. Drink now_2017."
Spain,Pagos del Rey,Tinta de Toro,89,30,"Pleasant red-fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry are low in octane for Toro. A fresh but not overly dense palate is lively and vital, with wild berry, plum and brown sugar flavors. A warm, heady, generous finish is fruity and bright. Drink through 2018."
Italy,Altesino,Sangiovese,89,40,"Here's a sleek Sangiovese that opens with scents of toasted oak, vanilla, blue flowers and mature plum. The round palate is already accessible, serving up sweet black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and mint framed in assertive but fine-grained tannins."
Italy,Cabreo,Red Blend,89,57,"A robust blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, mocha, menthol and oak-driven spice. The hearty palate initially opens with black fruit, chocolate, licorice and dried herb flavors but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and the close."
US,Cameron Hughes,Cabernet Sauvignon,89,29,"Juicy and soft in blackberry and black cherry, this wine is nicely resolved in terms of tannin and oak structure,. These provide weight on the back palate, with enough heightened acidity on the finish to stay on balance. Strawberry and dried herb close things out."
Chile,Casa Donoso,Red Blend,89,61,"Aromas of latex, tire rubber, spice, cured meat and berry fruits are rugged and require patience to sift through. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend is big and grabby, but not precise, with loud, herbal, muscular flavors of stewed plum, licorice and peppercorn."
US,Rodney Strong,Chardonnay,88,25,"Focused streaks of high-acidity lemon and a low oak profile combine for a refreshing take on Chardonnay, the other components coming together in swathes of fennel and brine. The wine finishes with a hit of power."
US,San Simeon,Syrah,88,25,"Oak aromas takes center stage with this wine by the Riboli family, with black cherry extract and a nearly Bourbon-barrel character on the nose. The rich, deep red fruit carries to the palate, which gains complexity from licorice and a tiny bit of tar."
US,Siduri,Pinot Noir,88,49,"Super earthy, in the classic damp forest-floor way, this also offers hints of menthol, eucalyptus and tomato leaf. The wine begins light bodied, but builds up power and weight as it goes. Layered with black cherry and plum, it's dark and savory."
US,Syncline,Picpoul,88,20,"Stainless-steel fermented and aged, this 100% varietal wine suggests kumquat, talc and wet stone. The flavor concentration is light with taut acidity the focus. It needs food; pair it with shellfish to see it shine."
Argentina,Piattelli,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88,26,"Dark, minty, inky aromas of blackberry are rugged. Same for the palate, which is pinched and rubbery, with grabby tannins. Flavors of toasted, blackened berry fruits are chocolaty and well oaked. Raw heat and minty, coffee flavors rev up the finish on this Malbec-led blend."
US,Pondera,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,88,34,"Merlot (57%) takes the lead on this lighter-colored wine that offers raspberries, cherries, herbs and woodspice. The fruit flavors are fresh and elegant, with lightly chalky tannins."
US,Tobin James,Zinfandel,88,38,"This is a lush and powerful wine from a vineyard in the recently designated Paso Highlands district. Aromas suggest gingerbread topped with kirsch-soaked, chocolate-covered cherries. The palate is thick and heavy, with mocha, stewed plums, mashed cherries and black earth, which gain complexity from tannins and pencil lead."
US,Tobin James,Zinfandel,88,38,"Hailing from the recently designated Paso Highlands subappellation, this hearty wine shows earthy aromas of nutmeg, iron, hot rocks, loam and cherry extract. It's lush and ripe with cassis and black cherry fruit, yet shows a more elegant chalkiness on the palate as well, rounded out by cocoa powder."
Spain,Valdesil,Godello,88,25,"Apple, nectarine, lees and briny aromas steer this Godello toward a round, full palate. Slightly bitter flavors of melon and peach finish much like the wine starts_briny and leesy. This is also pithy tasting, like the inside of a grapefruit peel."
Spain,Jaspi,Red Blend,87,22,"Coffee grinds, raisin and baked aromas suggest overripeness. This is heavy, broad and a bit clumsy on the palate. Berry and prune flavors are solid but not overly fresh, while the finish is full and raisiny as it improves over time."
Argentina,Tupun,Malbec,87,15,"Dark-berry aromas are crisp and show a note of minerality as well as barrel char. This is firm, juicy and modest in structure, with flavors of blackberry and cassis touched up by some oak. A non-pushy finish with a hint of mocha is a good close."
France,Chteau Beauregard Lagupeau,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,20,Bright fruit is allied to a more mineral structure to give a wine that shows the freshness of the vintage plus a more long-term view. It is cool with red fruits and some firm tannins that act as a background. Drink from 2017.
France,Chteau du Taillan,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,25,"Owned by the Cruse family, one of the Bordeaux wine aristocracy, this rich wine is dominated by Merlot, giving it ample weight. The 18 months of wood aging shows in the smoky edge to the wine, although this will soften. Drink from 2017."
France,Chteau la Haye,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,20,"The smoky aroma and toasty wood character smothers the fruit. It is a tough wine at this stage although it does hint at some of the 2012 juicy fruit flavors. Drink this firm, solid wine from 2018."
France,Chteau Lalande Mausse,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,20,"Intensely tannic, this structured wine has layers of wood aging, along with juicy fruits and bright acidity. There's a strongly smoky element, the wine's fruitiness balanced by a dark, toasty aftertaste. Drink from 2018."
France,Chteau Magnol,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,87,25,"This is a smoky, obviously wood-aged wine. The burnt toast character is still dominant, waiting for the attractive black currant fruits to catch up. It will develop into a bright, fruity wine, so wait until 2017."
US,Grand Pacific,Chardonnay,87,10,"A creamy, buttery texture wraps around a core of bright lemon and apple flavors. This is balanced slightly toward sweetness as the luxurious viscosity carries the vivid flavors into the finish."
US,Hamilton,Malbec,87,18,"This saigne-style wine is pale salmon in color, showing some bricking. It drinks dry with rounded suggestions of cherry and watermelon providing easy-drinking enjoyment."
US,Heron Hill,Chardonnay,87,18,"Zesty and mineral, this unoaked, citrusy Chardonnay would make a particularly refreshing apritif. Flavors of Asian pear and quince are crisp and cutting on the palate. Enjoy now for it's vivacious style."
US,Heron Hill,Riesling,87,14,"Smoke and violet perfume are seductive on this elegant off-dry Riesling. Fresh green apple and pear flavors are tart but concentrated, wrapping up tightly with a squeaky-clean, lemon-lime finish."
